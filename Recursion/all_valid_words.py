"""
You have an NxN matrix of characters and a list of valid words (provided in any
format you wish). A word can be formed by starting with any character and then
moving up, down, left, or right. Words do not have to be in a straight line
(PACKING is a word below). You cannot reuse a letter for the same word, so
GOING (in the grid below) would not be a word since it reuses the G.
Design an algorithm and write code to print all valid words.
